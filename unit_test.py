# Note:
# When a test case is running, Python prints one character for each unit test as it is completed. A passing test
# prints a dot, a test that results in an error prints an E, and a test that results in a failed assertion prints an
# F. This is why youâ€™ll see a different number of dots and characters on the first line of output when you run your
# test cases.

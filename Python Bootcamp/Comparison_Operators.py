# Table of Comparison Operators
# Operator	Description	Example
# ==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
# !=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true
# <>	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a <> b) is true. This is similar to != operator.
# >	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
# <	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
# >=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
# <=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.

# Equal
2 == 2  # True
1 == 0  # False


# Not Equal
2 != 1  # True
2 != 2  # False
2 <> 1  # True
2 <> 2  # False


# Greater Than
2 > 1   # True
2 > 4   # False

# Less Than

2 < 4   # True
2 < 1   # False

# Greater Than or Equal to
2 >= 2  # True
2 >= 1  # True

# Less than or Equal to
2 <= 2  # True
2 <= 4  # True

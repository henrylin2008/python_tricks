# The collections module is a built-in module that implements specialized container data types providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers. We've already gone over the basics: dict, list, set, and tuple.
#
# Now we'll learn about the alternatives that the collections module provides.
#
# Counter
# Counter is a dict subclass which helps count hash-able objects. Inside of it elements are stored as dictionary keys and the counts of the objects are stored as the value.
#
# Lets see how it can be used:
#
# In [1]:
import collections
from collections import Counter
# Counter() with lists
# In [2]:
l = [1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,2,1,12,3,2,32,1,21,1,223,1]
Counter(l)
# Out[2]:
# Counter({1: 6, 2: 6, 3: 4, 32: 1, 12: 1, 21: 1, 223: 1})


# Counter with strings
# In [3]:
Counter('aabsbsbsbhshhbbsbs')
# Out[3]:
# Counter({'b': 7, 's': 6, 'h': 3, 'a': 2})

# Counter with words in a sentence
# In [4]:
s = 'How many times does each word show up in this sentence word times each each word'
words = s.split()
Counter(words)
# Out[4]:
# Counter({'word': 3, 'each': 3, 'times': 2, 'show': 1, 'this': 1, 'many': 1, 'in': 1, 'up': 1, 'How': 1, 'does': 1, 'sentence': 1})
# In [5]:

# Methods with Counter()
c = Counter(words)
c.most_common(2)
# Out[5]:
# [('word', 3), ('each', 3)]

# Common patterns when using the Counter() object
# In [ ]:
# sum(c.values())                 # total of all counts
# c.clear()                       # reset all counts
# list(c)                         # list unique elements
# set(c)                          # convert to a set
# dict(c)                         # convert to a regular dictionary
# c.items()                       # convert to a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
# Counter(dict(list_of_pairs))    # convert from a list of (elem, cnt) pairs
# c.most_common()[:-n-1:-1]       # n least common elements
# c += Counter()                  # remove zero and negative counts


# defaultdict
# defaultdict is a dictionary like object which provides all methods provided by dictionary but takes first argument (default_factory) as default data type for the dictionary. Using defaultdict is faster than doing the same using dict.set_default method.

# A defaultdict will never raise a KeyError. Any key that does not exist gets the value returned by the default factory.

# In [12]:
from collections import defaultdict
# In [14]:
d = {}
# In [22]:
d['one']
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
# <ipython-input-22-07706fc5dc20> in <module>()
# ----> 1 d['one']
# KeyError: 'one'
# In [23]:
d  = defaultdict(object)
# In [24]:
d['one']
# Out[24]:
# <object at 0x1002c3a50>
# In [26]:
for item in d:
    print(item)
# one

# Can also initialize with default values:
# In [27]:
d = defaultdict(lambda: 0)
# In [28]:
# d['one']
# Out[28]:
# 0

# OrderedDict
# An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which its contents are added.

# Fro example a normal dictionary:

# In [32]:
print('Normal dictionary:')
d = {}
d['a'] = 'A'
d['b'] = 'B'
d['c'] = 'C'
d['d'] = 'D'
d['e'] = 'E'

for k, v in d.items():
    print k, v
# Normal dictionary:
# a A
# c C
# b B
# e E
# d D

# An Ordered Dictionary
# In [33]:
print('OrderedDict:')
import collections
d = collections.OrderedDict()

d['a'] = 'A'
d['b'] = 'B'
d['c'] = 'C'
d['d'] = 'D'
d['e'] = 'E'

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)
# OrderedDict:
# a A
# b B
# c C
# d D
# e E

# Equality with an Ordered Dictionary
# A regular dict looks at its contents when testing for equality. An OrderedDict also considers the order the items were added.

# A normal Dictionary:

# In [36]:
print('Dictionaries are equal? ')

d1 = {}
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'

d2 = {}
d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'

print(d1 == d2)
# Dictionaries are equal?
# True

# An Ordered Dictionary:
# In [37]:
print('Dictionaries are equal? ')

d1 = collections.OrderedDict()
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'

d2 = collections.OrderedDict()
d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'

print(d1 == d2)
# Dictionaries are equal?
# False

# namedtuple
# The standard tuple uses numerical indexes to access its members, for example:
# In [38]:
t = (12,13,14)
# In [39]:
t[0]
# Out[39]:
12

# For simple use cases, this is usually enough. On the other hand, remembering which index should be used for each value
# can lead to errors, especially if the tuple has a lot of fields and is constructed far from where it is used. A
# namedtuple assigns names, as well as the numerical index, to each member.
# Each kind of namedtuple is represented by its own class, created by using the namedtuple() factory function. The
# arguments are the name of the new class and a string containing the names of the elements.
# You can basically think of namedtuples as a very quick way of creating a new object/class type with some attribute
# fields. For example:
#
# In [40]:
from collections import namedtuple
# In [47]:
Dog = namedtuple('Dog','age breed name')

sam = Dog(age=2,breed='Lab',name='Sammy')

frank = Dog(age=2,breed='Shepard',name="Frankie")
# We construct the namedtuple by first passing the object type name (Dog) and then passing a string with the variety of
# fields as a string with spaces between the field names. We can then call on the various attributes:

# In [42]:
sam
# Out[42]:
# Dog(age=2, breed='Lab', name='Sammy')
# In [43]:
sam.age
# Out[43]:
# 2
# In [44]:
sam.breed
# Out[44]:
# 'Lab'
# In [45]:
sam[0]
# Out[45]:
# 2

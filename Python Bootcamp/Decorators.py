# Decorators
# Decorators can be thought of as functions which modify the functionality of another function. They help to make your
# code shorter and more "Pythonic".
#
# To properly explain decorators we will slowly build up from functions. Make sure to restart the Python and the
# Notebooks for this lecture to look the same on your own computer. So lets break down the steps:
#
# Functions Review
def func():
    return 1
func()  # 1

# Scope Review
# Remember from the nested statements lecture that Python uses Scope to know what a label is referring to. For example:

s = 'Global Variable'

def func():
    print(locals())
# Remember that Python functions create a new scope, meaning the function has its own namespace to find variable names
# when they are mentioned within the function. We can check for local variables and global variables with the local()
# and globals() functions. For example:

print(globals())
# {'_dh': [u'/Users/marci/Udemy-Complete-Python-Bootcamp'], '__': '', '_i': u"s = 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n
# print locals()", 'quit': <IPython.core.autocall.ZMQExitAutocall object at 0x1037e0a10>, '__builtins__':
# <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>, 's': 'Global Variable', '_ih': ['', u'def func():\n    return 1', u'func()', u"s =
# 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n    print locals()", u'print globals()', u'print globals().keys()', u"s = 'Global
# Variable'\n\ndef func():\n    print locals()", u'print globals()'], '__builtin__': <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>,
# '_2': 1, 'func': <function func at 0x10445aa28>, '__name__': '__main__', '___': '', '_': 1, '_sh':
# <module 'IPython.core.shadowns' from '//anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/core/shadowns.pyc'>, '_i7':
# u'print globals()', '_i6': u"s = 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n    print locals()", '_i5':
# u'print globals().keys()', '_i4': u'print globals()', '_i3': u"s = 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n
# print locals()", '_i2': u'func()', '_i1': u'def func():\n    return 1', '__doc__': 'Automatically created module for I
# Python interactive environment', '_iii': u'print globals()', 'exit': <IPython.core.autocall.ZMQExitAutocall object at
# 0x1037e0a10>, 'get_ipython': <bound method ZMQInteractiveShell.get_ipython of
# <IPython.kernel.zmq.zmqshell.ZMQInteractiveShell object at 0x1037c3990>>, '_ii': u'print globals().keys()', 'In': ['',
# u'def func():\n    return 1', u'func()', u"s = 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n    print locals()",
# u'print globals()', u'print globals().keys()', u"s = 'Global Variable'\n\ndef func():\n    print locals()",
# u'print globals()'], '_oh': {2: 1}, 'Out': {2: 1}}
# Here we get back a dictionary of all the global variables, many of them are predefined in Python. So let's go ahead
# and look at the keys:


print(globals().keys())
# ['_dh', '__', '_i', 'quit', '__builtins__', 's', '_ih', '__builtin__', '_2', 'func', '__name__', '___', '_', '_sh',
#  '_i8', '_i7', '_i6', '_i5', '_i4', '_i3', '_i2', '_i1', '__doc__', '_iii', 'exit', 'get_ipython', '_ii', 'In', '_oh',
#  'Out']



# Note how s is there, the Global Variable we defined as a string:

globals()['s']  #'Global Variable'
# Now lets run our function to check for any local variables in the func() (there shouldn't be any)

func()  # {}

# Great! Now lets continue with building out the logic of what a decorator is. Remember that in Python everything is an
# object. That means functions are objects which can be assigned labels and passed into other functions. Lets start
# with some simple examples:

def hello(name='Jose'):
    return 'Hello '+name

hello() # 'Hello Jose'

# Assign a label to the function. Note that e are not using parentheses here because we are not calling the function
# hello, instead we are just putting it into the greet variable.

greet = hello
greet   # <function __main__.hello>
greet() # 'Hello Jose'

# This assignment is not attached to the original function:

del hello

hello()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
# <ipython-input-18-a803225a2f97> in <module>()
# ----> 1 hello()

# NameError: name 'hello' is not defined


greet()     # 'Hello Jose'

# Functions within functions
# Great! So we've seen how we can treat functions as objects, now lets see how we can define functions inside of other
# functions:


def hello(name='Jose'):
    print('The hello() function has been executed')
    
    def greet():
        return '\t This is inside the greet() function'
    
    def welcome():
        return "\t This is inside the welcome() function"
    
    print(greet())
    print(welcome())
    print("Now we are back inside the hello() function")

hello()
# The hello() function has been executed
# 	 This is inside the greet() function
# 	 This is inside the welcome() function
# Now we are back inside the hello() function


welcome()
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
# <ipython-input-29-efaf77b113fd> in <module>()
# ----> 1 welcome()
#
# NameError: name 'welcome' is not defined
# Note how due to scope, the welcome() function is not defined outside of the hello() function. Now lets learn about
# returning functions from within functions:


# Returning Functions
def hello(name='Jose'):
    
    def greet():
        return '\t This is inside the greet() function'
    
    def welcome():
        return "\t This is inside the welcome() function"
    
    if name == 'Jose':
        return greet
    else:
        return welcome

x = hello()
# Now lets see what function is returned if we set x = hello(), note how the closed parenthesis means that name ahs
# been defined as Jose.

# In [40]:
x   # <function __main__.greet>


# Great! Now we can see how x is pointing to the greet function inside of the hello function.

print(x())
# 	 This is inside the greet() function
# Lets take a quick look at the code again.

# In the if/else clause we are returning greet and welcome, not greet() and welcome().

# This is because when you put a pair of parentheses after it, the function gets executed; whereas if you donâ€™t put
# parenthesis after it, then it can be passed around and can be assigned to other variables without executing it.

# When we write x = hello(), hello() gets executed and because the name is Jose by default, the function greet is
# returned. If we change the statement to x = hello(name = "Sam") then the welcome function will be returned. We can
# also do print hello()() which outputs now you are in the greet() function.


# Functions as Arguments
# Now lets see how we can pass functions as arguments into other functions:

def hello():
    return 'Hi Jose!'

def other(func):
    print('Other code would go here')
    print(func())

other(hello)
# Other code would go here
# Hi Jose!
# Great! Note how we can pass the functions as objects and then use them within other functions. Now we can get started
# with writing our first decorator:


# Creating a Decorator
# In the previous example we actually manually created a Decorator. Here we will modify it to make its use case clear:

def new_decorator(func):

    def wrap_func():
        print("Code would be here, before executing the func")

        func()

        print("Code here will execute after the func()")

    return wrap_func


def func_needs_decorator():
    print("This function is in need of a Decorator")


func_needs_decorator()
# This function is in need of a Decorator

# Reassign func_needs_decorator
func_needs_decorator = new_decorator(func_needs_decorator)
func_needs_decorator()
# Code would be here, before executing the func
# This function is in need of a Decorator
# Code here will execute after the func()
# So what just happened here? A decorator simple wrapped the function and modified its behavior. Now lets understand how we can
# rewrite this code using the @ symbol, which is what Python uses for Decorators:

@new_decorator
def func_needs_decorator():
    print("This function is in need of a Decorator")


func_needs_decorator()
# Code would be here, before executing the func
# This function is in need of a Decorator
# Code here will execute after the func()
